//! Minimal MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, listening on a second port
//! alongside the Postgres wire listener so AI agents can discover schema and
//! run queries without a Postgres driver. Hand-rolled HTTP + JSON-RPC 2.0
//! (see `http.rs`/`protocol.rs`) rather than pulling in hyper/axum, in
//! keeping with this project's hand-written-protocol approach — see
//! `protocol.rs` for the documented transport scope cuts.
