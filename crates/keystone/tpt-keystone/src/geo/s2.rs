//! S2-*inspired* hierarchical spatial grid: projects lon/lat onto one of
//! six cube faces (same core idea as Google's S2 — a near-equal-area
//! hierarchical decomposition of the sphere, avoiding lat/lon's polar
//! distortion) and quadtree-subdivides each face down to a configurable
//! level.
//!
//! Honest caveat: this is a from-scratch, simplified approximation of the
//! *idea*, not a port of the real S2 library — it skips S2's tangent
//! ("quadratic"/ST) reprojection curve (uses a linear UV→grid mapping
//! instead) and its Hilbert-curve cell numbering (uses direct row-major
//! `(face, level, i, j)` packing instead). It is not bit-compatible with
//! real S2 cell ids and cannot interoperate with other S2 implementations.
//! What it does provide, correctly: a real hierarchical decomposition
//! (`parent`/`children` shrink/grow the cell by exactly one grid level) and
//! locality (nearby points map to nearby or identical cells), which is what
//! the spatial index (`storage::geo_index`) actually needs.
