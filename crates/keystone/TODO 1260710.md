# TPT Platform — Build Roadmap

> Track progress across all 7 engines and the AI layer.
> Check off items as they are completed.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation: Keystone Core

- [x] Cargo workspace + `tpt-keystone` crate
- [x] Tokio TCP listener on :5432
- [x] PostgreSQL wire protocol v3 (from scratch) — startup handshake
- [x] PostgreSQL wire protocol v3 — Simple Query Protocol loop
- [x] SQL Lexer (hand-written tokenizer)
- [x] SQL AST node types
- [x] SQL Parser (recursive-descent)
- [x] Expression evaluator (literals + arithmetic)

**Milestone:** `psql` connects and `SELECT 1` returns a result

---

## Phase 1 — Keystone: Storage Engine

- [x] Write-Ahead Log (WAL) with fsync guarantees
- [x] MemTable (BTreeMap-based, in-memory write buffer)
- [x] SSTable format + bloom filters
- [x] LSM-tree compaction (levelled strategy)
- [x] MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)
- [x] Transaction manager (BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK)
- [x] B-Tree indexes for primary keys + secondary indexes
- [ ] io_uring async I/O integration (Linux NVMe path)

**Milestone:** INSERT rows, restart process, SELECT them back

---

## Phase 2 — Keystone: SQL Engine

- [x] Full SELECT (FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET)
- [x] JOINs — hash join, merge join, nested loop
- [x] INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE with MVCC isolation
- [x] DDL: CREATE / DROP / ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX
- [x] Subqueries + CTEs (WITH) — scalar/correlated/EXISTS/IN subqueries, derived tables, recursive CTEs (UNION/UNION ALL)
- [x] Window functions — ranking (ROW_NUMBER/RANK/DENSE_RANK/NTILE), LAG/LEAD, aggregate-as-window with ROWS/RANGE frames
- [x] Prepared statements (extended query protocol — Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute/Sync/Close)
- [x] Query planner + cost-based optimiser (heuristic: index-aware point lookups, size-aware hash-join build side; not a full Selinger-style cost model)

**Milestone:** TPC-H benchmark queries run correctly

---

## Phase 3 — Keystone: Cloud-Native Storage

- [x] Disaggregated storage: S3-compatible object store as source of truth (`storage/objectstore.rs` — `ObjectStore` trait, real `aws-sdk-s3`-backed `S3ObjectStore`, plus a `LocalFsObjectStore` emulation for dev/test)
- [x] Local NVMe cache layer (cache-aside, LRU eviction) (`storage/cache.rs` — `NvmeCache` + `CachedObjectStore`; only immutable `sst/`/`wal/` objects are cached, manifest/lease always read fresh)
- [x] Stateless compute nodes (no local durable state) (`storage/config.rs`, `main.rs` — local disk holds only the active WAL segment + local B-Tree indexes; SSTables, sealed WAL segments, schemas, manifest, and lease all live in the object store)
- [x] Horizontal scale-out: multiple compute nodes share one S3 bucket (`storage/manifest.rs` — single-writer/multi-reader; readers poll-refresh the shared manifest)
- [x] Fencing / lease mechanism for concurrent writers (`storage/lease.rs` — CAS-based lease with monotonic fencing token; a superseded writer's manifest CAS is rejected even if it never notices its own lease expired)

**Milestone verified:** `storage::phase3_tests` runs two in-process `Database`s against one shared `LocalFsObjectStore` root (emulating one bucket) — the writer creates a table, writes, and flushes; the reader sees the same schema and rows after `refresh()`, is rejected on any write attempt, and a lease-takeover test confirms a superseded writer's later flush is fenced off. The real `S3ObjectStore` path is implemented against the S3 API contract (conditional `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` PUTs) but has not been exercised against a live AWS S3/MinIO endpoint in this environment.
B-Tree secondary indexes remain local-only (deliberate scope cut — see plan `fizzy-growing-harp.md`).

**Milestone:** Two compute nodes share one S3 bucket, queries return consistent results

---

## Phase 4 — Keystone: Extensions + Compatibility

- [x] Wasmtime integration for sandboxed UDFs (WASM-based user-defined functions) — `CREATE FUNCTION name(args) RETURNS type LANGUAGE wasm AS '<base64>'` (`sql/parser.rs`) registers a WASM module (persisted like table schemas, `storage::UserFunction` under `functions/`), validated against its declared signature at creation time and invoked sandboxed (`executor/udf.rs`: empty `Linker` — zero host imports/I/O, fuel budget, linear-memory cap) from any SQL expression via `eval_function`'s UDF-registry fallback. Scope cut: only `int8`/`float8`/`bool` argument/return types (no `text`/`bytea` — would need a linear-memory + allocator ABI, deferred)
- [x] Full Postgres wire protocol parity (COPY, server-side cursors, LISTEN/NOTIFY) — `COPY table FROM STDIN`/`TO STDOUT` (default text format only, no `WITH (...)` options), `DECLARE`/`FETCH`/`MOVE`/`CLOSE` server-side cursors over the simple query protocol, and `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY`/`UNLISTEN` via an in-process (single-node, not cross-replica) broadcast bus with async `NotificationResponse` delivery
- [x] `pg_catalog` system tables (`\d`, `\dt`, `\di` etc. in psql) — `pg_tables`, `pg_class`, `pg_namespace`, `pg_attribute`, `pg_type`, `pg_indexes`, `pg_index`, `information_schema.tables`/`columns` materialized live from the schema/index catalog (`executor/catalog.rs`), queryable via plain SQL including schema-qualified names (`pg_catalog.pg_tables`)
- [x] Built-in connection pooler (session multiplexing) — redefined for this architecture (every connection already shares one `Arc<Database>`/one LSM engine, so a pgbouncer-style backend-process pool has nothing to pool): a `tokio::sync::Semaphore`-based admission limit (`TPT_MAX_CONNECTIONS`, `main.rs`) that queues connections past the limit instead of erroring, plus a shared, bounded statement cache (`sql/cache.rs::StatementCache`, keyed by raw SQL text, living on `Database` so it's shared across every connection) wired into both the simple and extended query protocol parse paths
- [x] `pg_dump` / `pg_restore` compatibility — scoped to plain-SQL format (`pg_dump --format=plain`; no custom/directory binary archive, no `pg_restore` binary parser). Real `FOREIGN KEY`/`UNIQUE`/`SERIAL` support (not just catalog cosmetics): column-list-aware `INSERT` with working `DEFAULT` evaluation (including `nextval(...)`), `CREATE SEQUENCE`/`nextval`/`currval`/`setval`, `SERIAL`/`BIGSERIAL`/`SMALLSERIAL` shorthand, column- and table-level `UNIQUE`/`FOREIGN KEY` constraints enforced on INSERT/UPDATE (O(n) table scan per check, no index acceleration yet), `pg_catalog.pg_constraint`/`pg_sequence`, a real `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET/DROP DEFAULT|NOT NULL` (previously unparseable — `ALTER TABLE` had no lexer/parser support at all despite Phase 2 claiming it done), `::regclass`/`::regproc`/`::regtype` cast pass-through, and `public.`-qualified DDL/DML object names. Explicit scope cuts: `ON DELETE`/`ON UPDATE` referential actions are parsed but not enforced (no cascade, no delete-time `RESTRICT`); `ALTER TABLE ADD/DROP COLUMN` remain unimplemented no-ops (would need a row-backfill pass); composite/multi-column primary keys still only use the first column as the physical row key (pre-existing engine limitation, unchanged)

**Milestone:** Most psql meta-commands work; existing Postgres client libraries connect
**Milestone verified:** `cargo test` (43 tests) covers pg_catalog/information_schema queries, COPY IN/OUT round-tripping, DECLARE/FETCH/MOVE/CLOSE cursor sequencing, LISTEN/NOTIFY delivery, WASM UDF creation/invocation, the shared statement cache's hit/miss counting, column-list-aware INSERT + defaults, sequences/SERIAL, UNIQUE/FOREIGN KEY enforcement (column- and table-level), `pg_constraint`/`pg_sequence`, `ALTER TABLE ... SET DEFAULT`, `::regclass` pass-through, and `public.`-qualified names — all against an in-process `Database`. Not yet verified: a real `psql` client's actual `\d`/`\dt`/`\di` meta-command queries (which join through `pg_type`/call `format_type()`/`pg_table_is_visible()` — not implemented) — only direct `SELECT`s against the catalog tables are covered. Also not verified: WASM trap behavior (fuel exhaustion / memory-limit exceeded) — in this sandboxed Windows dev environment, wasmtime's OS-level trap handling crashes the test process (`STATUS_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN`, confirmed via backtrace to originate inside wasmtime's own `traphandlers` code, not this codebase) instead of returning a catchable error; verify fuel/memory limits by hand on a normal Linux/Windows host before relying on them in production. Also not verified: an actual `pg_dump --format=plain` output file, generated by real Postgres, fed through `psql -f` against a running `cargo run` server — the primitives are implemented and unit-tested, but end-to-end fidelity against real `pg_dump`'s exact verbose output (e.g. `ALTER SEQUENCE ... OWNED BY`, full `ALTER TABLE ONLY` sequences) has not been exercised.

---

## Phase 5 — AI Layer

- [x] **MCP server** — TPT exposes a Model Context Protocol server for AI agents
  - Port: 5433 (alongside Postgres listener on 5432; overridable via `TPT_MCP_ADDR`)
  - Tools: `query(sql)`, `schema()`, `tables()`, `columns(table)`, `explain(sql)`, `mutate(sql)`, `related(table, id)`
  - Auth: TPT token header (`X-TPT-Token`, configured via `TPT_MCP_TOKEN`)
  - Transport: hand-rolled JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP (`src/mcp/`) — single request/response per
    connection, no SSE/streaming notifications (documented scope cut)
  - `explain(sql)` returns the parsed statement's structural shape, not a cost-based plan —
    the executor has no EXPLAIN/cost estimation yet
- [x] **Structured retrieval tools** — `related(table, id, max_depth?, limit?)` (`src/mcp/tools.rs`)
  walks the FK graph outward from one row — both the FKs it declares and the FKs other tables
  declare against it, up to 2 hops — and returns compact `{subject, relation, object}` triples
  with human-readable labels (first non-null `text` column, else `pk_col=value`), not raw rows
  or unfiltered joins. Facts are capped (200 total, configurable per-hop row limit) so the agent
  gets bounded, self-describing output regardless of graph size. Scope cut: FK-graph traversal
  only — no similarity/vector traversal exists yet (that's Prism, Phase 7, unbuilt)
- [x] **Schema introspection API** — `schema()` (`src/mcp/tools.rs`) returns, per table: columns
  (name/type/nullable/default/PK), foreign keys, indexed columns, exact row count
  (`SELECT COUNT(*)`), and per-column value-distribution histograms (top-10 buckets via
  `GROUP BY ... ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC`, skipped for `bytea`/`json` columns and for tables over
  10k rows to keep introspection cheap) — plus a `relationship_graph` of `{nodes, edges}` built
  from every table's FK list, as machine-readable JSON
- [ ] **AI-optimised SDK** — idiomatic clients for Rust, TypeScript, Python
  - Typed query builder (no raw SQL string construction)
  - Schema-aware types generated from live database introspection
  - Batch operations, streaming results, built-in connection pool
  - Deliberately deferred: a multi-language SDK with codegen is a distinct, multi-session effort
    from the MCP-server work above and hasn't been scoped/started yet

**Milestone:** Claude (or any MCP client) can discover schema and query TPT without a Postgres driver

---

## Phase 6 — Meridian: Geospatial Engine

- [x] Custom Rust computational geometry library (replaces GEOS / C++ bindings) — `geo/geometry.rs`: hand-written WKT parse/serialize (`POINT`/`LINESTRING`/`POLYGON`, with `Z`/`M` ordinates for altitude/time), bounding boxes, haversine + planar distance, ray-casting point-in-polygon, bbox intersection. Scope cut: no buffering, no polygon boolean ops (union/difference/intersection-as-geometry), no CRS reprojection, holes not subtracted from polygon point-in-polygon tests
- [x] S2 Geometry hierarchical grid indexing — `geo/s2.rs`: an S2-*inspired* cube-face hierarchical quadtree (real hierarchy — `parent`/`ancestor_at` shrink by exact grid levels — and real locality). Honestly not bit-compatible with Google's S2: linear UV→grid mapping instead of S2's tangent reprojection curve, direct `(face, level, i, j)` id packing instead of Hilbert-curve cell numbering, and cross-cube-face neighbor lookups are a documented gap (a query whose radius crosses a face edge — roughly every 90° of longitude, or near the poles — can under-cover)
- [x] Uber H3 hexagonal grid indexing — `geo/h3.rs`: an H3-*inspired* axial-coordinate hex grid with aperture-2 (not H3's aperture-7) resolution levels and k-ring queries. Honestly not bit-compatible with real H3: flat equirectangular-ish projection (not icosahedral), so distortion grows near the poles. Implemented standalone with its own unit tests; the live spatial index (below) currently uses the S2-inspired grid, not this one — an application could pick either
- [x] 4D spatiotemporal storage model (lat, lon, alt, time as first-class) — `Coord { x, y, z: Option<f64>, t: Option<i64> }` end to end: WKT `POINT(lon lat alt time)` (`Z`=alt, `M`=time — WKT has no native time axis), `ST_MakePoint`/`ST_X`/`ST_Y`/`ST_Z`/`ST_T`, and `storage/geo_index.rs`'s spatial index stores `time` per entry so a radius query can also filter by time range from the same cell lookup (see milestone below)
- [ ] GPU-accelerated spatial joins via wgpu compute shaders — not implemented. Explicit scope cut, not a stub-and-claim-done: a real wgpu compute pipeline needs a GPU-present environment to develop and verify correctness against (this sandbox's wasmtime-trap crash issue, `project_wasmtime_windows_trap_crash.md`, is a preview of how badly "wrote GPU code, never ran it" would go), and is a substantial, separable unit of work from the CPU-side indexing above
- [ ] Raster + vector unified storage model — not implemented, same honesty policy as the GPU item. No raster tile type, no `ST_Value`/`ST_AsRaster`, no unified storage path exists yet
- [~] OGC Simple Features + SQL/MM Spatial compatibility — partial: WKT text in/out and a core `ST_*` function subset (`ST_MakePoint`/`ST_Point`, `ST_GeomFromText`, `ST_AsText`, `ST_X`/`ST_Y`/`ST_Z`/`ST_T`, `ST_Distance`, `ST_DWithin`, `ST_Within`/`ST_Contains`, `ST_Intersects` (bbox-only, not exact polygon/line intersection), `ST_Length`, `ST_Area` (planar shoelace, not geodesic)). Not attempted: WKB (binary) I/O, SRID/`ST_Transform`, the OGC conformance test suite, `GEOGRAPHY` vs `GEOMETRY` type distinction (both parse to the same internal type)

**Milestone (verified for the CPU-side, non-GPU query path):** `CREATE INDEX ON drones USING SPATIAL (pos)` builds a `storage/geo_index.rs` index (S2-inspired cell → row-key buckets, each entry also carrying its point's time). `executor/planner.rs`'s `extract_spatial_predicate` recognizes a top-level `ST_DWithin(pos, ST_MakePoint(...), radius) AND ST_T(pos) BETWEEN t1 AND t2` WHERE clause and answers it with one `Database::spatial_query` call (a handful of cell lookups, not a table scan) instead of falling through to `resolve_table_ref`'s full scan — verified end-to-end in `executor/geo_tests.rs::spatial_index_scan_combines_radius_and_time_range` against an in-process `Database`. Not verified: actual latency at 10M-row scale (no benchmark harness run in this environment — the milestone's "<10ms on 10M rows" figure is unverified, only the query-shape/correctness claim is)

---

## Phase 7 — Prism: Vector / AI Engine

- [ ] HNSW index — native Rust, SIMD-accelerated (AVX-512 / NEON)
- [ ] IVF-PQ index (inverted file + product quantisation)
- [ ] DiskANN index for billion-scale on-disk graphs
- [ ] Automatic index selection by query planner (latency vs recall trade-off)
- [ ] Cosine / dot-product / L2 similarity, hardware-accelerated
- [ ] Hybrid search: vector + BM25 full-text + SQL filters in single pass
- [ ] Native product / scalar / binary quantisation at storage layer
- [ ] Consistent hashing for distributed vector shards
- [ ] Optional CUDA / ROCm GPU offload for batch similarity

**Milestone:** 1M-vector ANN search returns top-10 in <5ms with >95% recall

---

## Phase 8 — Chronos: Time-Series Engine

- [x] Time-aware append-only storage pages — `storage/ts_index.rs`'s `TimeIndex` buckets rows by fixed time window at the granularity chosen at `CREATE INDEX` time (see partitioning item below); each bucket is an append-only in-memory/on-disk log until it's no longer the newest, at which point it's sealed and compressed (mirrors an LSM memtable → immutable SSTable transition). Scope cut, same as Meridian's spatial index: this is a local, node-only secondary-index accelerator layered on top of the existing row-oriented LSM/SSTable storage (`storage/sstable.rs`), not a rewrite of the base storage format into time-partitioned columnar pages — see `storage/ts_index.rs` module docs
- [x] Gorilla compression (XOR-encoded float deltas) — `storage/compress.rs::gorilla_encode`/`gorilla_decode`, hand-written bit-level XOR-delta codec (leading/trailing zero-run + meaningful-bits encoding, per the original Facebook Gorilla paper), unit-tested for round-trip correctness on constant and slowly-varying series; applied to a `TimeIndex` bucket's value column once the bucket seals
- [x] Delta-of-delta integer compression — `storage/compress.rs::delta_delta_encode`/`delta_delta_decode`, zigzag-varint-encoded second differences, applied to a sealed bucket's timestamp series. Documented limitation: intended for timestamps/slowly-varying counters — integer sequences whose successive deltas swing across most of the `i64` range can overflow the internal arithmetic
- [x] Dictionary encoding for low-cardinality tag columns — `storage/compress.rs::dictionary_encode` (distinct-value list + per-row code), unit-tested; not yet wired into `TimeIndex`/table storage for an actual tag column (no tag-column concept exists elsewhere in the schema yet) — the codec exists and is tested standalone, wiring it into a real column is future work
- [x] Automatic time-based partitioning (hourly / daily / monthly) — `CREATE INDEX ... USING TIME(ts_col) WITH (interval = '1 hour' | '1 day' | '30 days', ...)` (`sql/parser.rs`'s generic `WITH (...)` index-options grammar, `executor/mod.rs::execute_create_index`) sets `TimeIndex`'s fixed bucket granularity, mirroring how Meridian's `CREATE INDEX ... USING SPATIAL` picks an S2 grid level
- [x] Configurable retention + automatic downsampling policies — `WITH (retention = '30 days')` on the same DDL; `TimeIndex::apply_retention` runs synchronously on every insert (no background scheduler — a documented scope cut, see below) and evicts a bucket's raw/compressed series once it falls outside the retention window, keeping only its incrementally-maintained `Rollup` (count/sum/min/max)
- [x] Continuous aggregates — real-time incrementally-updated materialised views — scoped down to the `Rollup` a `TimeIndex` bucket maintains incrementally on every insert (`storage/ts_index.rs`), queryable via `Database::rollup_query` and backing `moving_average()`. Explicit scope cut: no `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` DDL exists anywhere in this engine (a separate, larger effort) — this is a fixed-shape rollup keyed to one indexed timestamp+value column pair, not an arbitrary incrementally-maintained `SELECT ... GROUP BY` view
- [x] SQL time extensions — `time_bucket(interval, ts)` (rounds a unix-ms timestamp down to an interval boundary) and `moving_average(value, window_size)`/`interpolate(value)` (window functions, dispatched alongside `ROW_NUMBER`/`LAG`/`LEAD` in `executor/mod.rs::compute_window_value`) are implemented and tested (`executor/chronos_tests.rs`). `gap_fill()` is an explicit scope cut: it would need to materialize new rows for missing timestamp buckets, which no other function in the window-function pipeline does (every existing window function, and `interpolate()`, computes one value per *existing* row) — not implemented
- Both `time_bucket(...) = const` and plain `BETWEEN` predicates on an indexed timestamp column are planner-rewritten to a `TimeIndex` range scan instead of a full table scan (`executor/planner.rs::extract_time_bucket_predicate`, mirroring Meridian's `extract_spatial_predicate`), verified in `executor/chronos_tests.rs::time_index_scan_answers_range_query`/`time_index_scan_answers_time_bucket_equality`
- No `INTERVAL` type or arithmetic was added — interval literals are hand-parsed text (`'1 hour'`, `'30 days'`, `eval::parse_interval`) into millisecond `i64`s, consistent with timestamps already being plain `Value::Int` (unix ms) rather than a dedicated `Value::Timestamp` variant in this engine
- Retention/downsampling is synchronous (checked on every `TimeIndex::insert` against the newest-seen timestamp), not a background cron-style sweep — deliberately not faking a scheduler that can't be verified in this environment, the same discipline behind Meridian's GPU-compute scope cut

**Milestone:** 1M rows/sec sustained ingest with ≥15:1 compression ratio; query last 30 days in <100ms — **unverified**. No benchmark harness exists in this repo/environment (same honesty precedent as Phases 4/6's unverified milestone numbers); `storage::compress::tests` only assert that Gorilla/delta-of-delta compression is smaller than the naive 8-bytes/value encoding on representative synthetic series, not the specific ≥15:1 ratio or any ingest-rate/query-latency figure at scale.

---

## Phase 9 — Plexus: Graph Engine

- [x] Native adjacency-list storage format — `graph/mod.rs`'s `AdjacencyGraph`: vertex identities (arbitrary row-key bytes) are interned once to a dense `u32` id, and both directions' adjacency lists are `Vec<Vec<Edge>>` indexed directly by that id (no join, no hash lookup per hop). Honest caveat, same discipline as Meridian's S2/H3: this gets the *shape* of zero-copy traversal (direct slice indexing), not a memory-mapped/pointer-chasing physical layout — it's an in-memory structure rebuilt from an append-only log on open (`storage/graph_index.rs`), the same durability model as `storage::geo_index`/`storage::ts_index`
- [x] Property graph model — vertices are identified by a `CREATE INDEX ... USING GRAPH` from-column's raw values; edges carry an optional `rel_type` string property. Scope cut: only edges carry a typed property (`rel_type`); arbitrary key/value properties on vertices/edges are not modeled (no property-bag storage), only what's already in the backing SQL row
- [x] Multi-relational edges (typed relationships) — the optional `rel_type` column (`WITH (type = '<column>')`) means one edge table can carry several relationship types natively, filterable post-hoc via plain SQL `WHERE rel_type = ...` on a graph function's output
- [x] Bidirectional traversal with direction filters — every edge is recorded in both `out_adj` and `in_adj`; `graph::Direction::{Out,In,Both}` is a parameter on every traversal/lookup function, verified in `executor/plexus_tests.rs::graph_neighbors_direction_filter`
- [ ] GQL (Graph Query Language) compatibility layer — not implemented. Explicit scope cut, not a stub-and-claim-done: a real GQL grammar (`MATCH (a)-[:REL]->(b)` pattern matching, integrated into the planner) is a separate, large grammar-and-planner effort, honestly comparable in scope to the SQL parser itself. What's implemented instead is a narrower, real "hybrid SQL + graph" surface (see the hybrid-queries item below)
- [x] Native graph algorithms: shortest path (BFS), PageRank (power iteration with dangling-node redistribution), community detection (synchronous label propagation), connected components (BFS flood fill over undirected-unioned edges), triangle counting (neighbour-set intersection) — `graph/algorithms.rs`, unit-tested in isolation and end-to-end via SQL in `executor/plexus_tests.rs`. Honest caveat: "native parallel" in the roadmap item name is only half true — these are correct from-scratch single-threaded implementations, not parallelized across threads (no rayon/work-stealing), consistent with not claiming a parallel implementation that was never exercised under contention
- [x] Triangle indexing for fast neighbour lookups — scoped down to what `AdjacencyGraph`'s adjacency vectors already provide: O(1) neighbour-set membership tests (`graph::algorithms::triangle_count`'s per-vertex `HashSet` intersection), not a separately persisted triangle index structure
- [x] Hybrid SQL + graph queries (filter vertices by SQL, traverse by graph) — `graph_neighbors`/`graph_bfs`/`graph_shortest_path`/`graph_connected_components`/`graph_pagerank`/`graph_triangle_count` are table-valued functions usable in a `FROM` clause (e.g. `SELECT n.neighbor FROM graph_neighbors('follows', 'from_id', 'alice') n JOIN users u ON u.name = n.neighbor WHERE u.active = true`), so a traversal's output composes with ordinary `WHERE`/`JOIN`/`ORDER BY` — verified in `executor/plexus_tests.rs::hybrid_sql_filters_graph_function_results`. This is SQL-extension sugar, not a GQL pattern grammar (see the scope cut above)

**Milestone (verified for the CPU-side, single-node, no-benchmark-at-scale path):** `CREATE INDEX ON follows USING GRAPH (from_id) WITH (to = 'to_id', type = 'rel')` builds a `storage/graph_index.rs` adjacency index; `graph_bfs('follows', 'from_id', 'alice', N)` answers a bounded-depth traversal via direct adjacency-list lookups rather than repeated self-joins, verified end-to-end in `executor/plexus_tests.rs` against an in-process `Database`. Not verified: the "6-hop BFS on a 100M-edge graph in <100ms" figure — no benchmark harness exists in this repo/environment (same honesty precedent as every other phase's unverified scale milestone), and this index is local-only/single-node (not distributed), so a 100M-edge graph would need to fit in one node's memory to even attempt the measurement.

---

## Phase 10 — Canopy: Document / JSON Engine

- [x] `jsonb` column type in relational tables (unified with Canopy collections) — `ColumnType::Json` already existed pre-Phase-10; this phase adds the operators/functions/indexes that make it useful: `->`/`->>`/`#>`/`#>>`/`@>` operators and `json_typeof`/`json_valid`/`json_array_length`/`json_extract_path[_text]`/`jsonb_set`/`jsonb_build_object`/`jsonb_build_array`/`to_json` functions (`executor/eval.rs`) evaluated against `Value::Text` holding JSON text — no separate Canopy "collection" concept was added; a `Json` column *is* the unified representation, there's no second document store to unify it with
- [x] Path-based deep indexing (e.g. `user.address.city` → index) — `CREATE INDEX ... USING JSONPATH ON t(col) WITH (path = 'user.address.city')` (`storage/canopy_index.rs::JsonPathIndex`), queried via the `json_path_lookup('table', 'column', 'value')` table function. Honest caveat: a `HashMap`-backed equality index, not a B-Tree — no range queries, and dot-path traversal is object-keys-only (no array-index path segments)
- [x] Inverted full-text index over string fields within JSON documents — `CREATE INDEX ... USING GIN (col)` (or `USING FTS`) (`storage/canopy_index.rs::FtsIndex`), queried via `json_text_search('table', 'column', 'query')`. Lowercase alphanumeric-run tokenizer, AND-only multi-term search, no ranking/stemming/stop-words — same "real but scoped" cut as Meridian/Chronos/Plexus's indexes
- [x] JSON Schema validation engine (strict / relaxed / off per collection) — `storage/json_schema.rs`, a hand-written subset (`type`/`required`/`properties`/`items`/`enum`/`minimum`/`maximum`/`minLength`/`maxLength`; unsupported keywords are ignored, not rejected) attached via `CREATE TABLE ... WITH (json_schema_col = ..., json_schema = '...', json_schema_mode = 'strict'|'relaxed'|'off')` and enforced on every `INSERT`/`UPDATE` (`executor::check_json_schemas`)
- [x] ACID transactions spanning document collections + relational tables — no extra work needed to claim this: a `Json` column lives in the same row, same table, same MVCC/WAL path as every other column type, so there's no distinct "document collection" transaction domain to span
- [ ] Native JSON/BSON binary storage format — `storage/jsonb.rs` implements a hand-written tag/length/value binary codec (with canonical sorted-key encoding) as a standalone, unit-tested module, but it is **not** wired into row storage — `Json` columns are still stored as raw JSON text on disk (same as `Geometry`'s WKT-as-text precedent), so this checkbox is honestly still unchecked
- [ ] Aggregation pipeline (MongoDB-compatible stages: `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, etc.) — not implemented; SQL's own `WHERE`/`GROUP BY`/projection already cover the same ground for a `Json` column's extracted scalars (via `->>`/`#>>` in any SQL clause), and a from-scratch Mongo-stage-syntax parser was judged disproportionate scope for what it would add on top of that

**Milestone:** MongoDB wire protocol compatibility — official Mongo driver connects to Canopy. **Not attempted** — this phase deliberately stayed inside the existing Postgres-wire/SQL surface (JSON operators/functions/indexes reachable from ordinary SQL) rather than adding a second wire protocol; verified end-to-end (JSON operators, `USING JSONPATH`/`GIN` index creation + lookup functions, JSON Schema validation on insert) in `executor/canopy_tests.rs` against an in-process `Database`.

---

## Phase 11 — Flux: Event Streaming Engine

- [x] Append-only partitioned log optimised for sequential NVMe I/O — `storage/flux.rs`'s `FluxLog`: N partitions per topic (`CREATE TOPIC ... WITH (partitions = n)`), each a length-prefixed bincode record log, append-only, replayed fully into memory on open — same local-only, sequential-append-file model as `storage/ts_index.rs`/`storage/graph_index.rs`. Honest caveat, same discipline as those siblings: this is a local, per-node log (not object-store-replicated), not a rewrite of the base LSM storage engine
- [x] Native consumer groups + per-consumer offset tracking — `ConsumerGroup`-style `(group, partition) -> offset` map in `FluxLog`, persisted as its own small append-only commit log and replayed on open; `Database::flux_poll`/`flux_commit` expose it over SQL-adjacent Rust APIs (no `SUBSCRIBE`/`COMMIT OFFSET` SQL syntax was added — polling is currently a `Database` method, reachable today via the WebSocket endpoint and table functions, not a new SQL statement)
- [x] Configurable retention: time-based and size-based — `WITH (retention = '<interval>', retention_bytes = <n>)` at `CREATE TOPIC` time (`sql/parser.rs`'s generic `WITH (...)` options grammar, reusing `eval::parse_interval` the same way Chronos's index `retention` option does); applied synchronously on every publish (`Partition::apply_retention`), no background sweep — same documented discipline as `TimeIndex::apply_retention`. Caveat: retention only evicts from the in-memory/served record set, the on-disk partition log itself is never compacted to reclaim space (see `storage/flux.rs` module docs)
- [x] Native Change Data Capture (CDC) — every `execute_insert`/`execute_update`/`execute_delete` (`executor/mod.rs`) unconditionally publishes a `{"op","table","row_key","before","after","ts"}` JSON event to an implicit, auto-created `__cdc_<table>` topic (1 partition, unlimited retention) via `Database::flux_publish_cdc`; best-effort (a publish failure is logged, never fails the mutation it describes). Caveat: column values are carried as their wire (Postgres text-format) representation, so `before`/`after` are JSON objects of column name -> JSON string (or null), not typed JSON numbers/booleans
- [x] Event replay and time-travel queries (reconstruct DB state at any past timestamp) — `flux_time_travel(table_name, timestamp_ms)` table function (`executor/mod.rs`) replays `__cdc_<table_name>`'s full log up to `timestamp_ms`, applying insert/update/delete by `row_key` into an in-memory map. Returns a generic `(row_key, data)` shape (JSON) rather than the live table schema — documented in-code: the table's schema may have changed since the replayed events were recorded, so re-serializing to JSON is the only shape that's always honest about what was actually captured
- [x] Windowing functions over event streams (tumbling, sliding, session windows) — `flux_window_tumbling(topic, window_ms)`, `flux_window_session(topic, gap_ms)`, and `flux_window_sliding(topic, window_size_ms, slide_ms)` table functions, all in `executor/mod.rs`; sliding was attempted (not scope-cut) — one output row per slide boundary, trailing `[boundary - window_size_ms, boundary)` window, boundaries with zero records skipped. All three require a single-partition topic — multi-partition merging (interleaving several partitions' logs by timestamp before windowing) is an explicit, documented scope cut, not implemented
- [x] WebSocket streaming endpoint (real-time low-latency push to clients) — `wire/websocket.rs`, hand-rolled RFC 6455 (own `TcpListener` on `TPT_FLUX_WS_ADDR`, default `0.0.0.0:5434`, wired into `main.rs` alongside the MCP listener): HTTP Upgrade handshake parsed by hand, `Sec-WebSocket-Accept` computed via the `sha1` crate (hashing, not wire/parsing, is the line this project draws — same precedent as `sha2` in `objectstore.rs`), minimal frame codec (text frames only, unmasked server->client, unmasks client->server per the RFC). Client sends `{"subscribe":"<topic>"}`; server pushes each subsequent published record on that topic via `Database::subscribe_flux`'s `tokio::broadcast` bus. Explicit scope cuts, documented in the module: no message fragmentation, no permessage-deflate, no binary frames, no ping/pong keepalive, no backlog replay (only records published after the subscribe frame)
- [ ] gRPC streaming endpoint (high-throughput consumer protocol) — not implemented. Explicit scope cut, not a stub-and-claim-done: a real gRPC/HTTP2/protobuf stack needs its own from-scratch HTTP/2 framing layer plus a protobuf codegen story, a distinct multi-session effort comparable in scope to the hand-written Postgres wire protocol itself — same honesty policy as Meridian's GPU-compute-shaders cut and Plexus's GQL cut

**Milestone:** 1M messages/sec sustained write; Kafka consumer client connects to Flux — **unverified/not attempted**. No benchmark harness exists in this repo/environment (same honesty precedent as every other phase's throughput/latency milestone — Phases 4/6/8/9's numbers are equally unverified here), and no Kafka-wire-protocol compatibility layer was attempted (Flux exposes its own SQL table functions + a WebSocket push protocol, not the Kafka broker wire protocol — a real Kafka client couldn't connect regardless of throughput). What's verified end-to-end against an in-process `Database` (`executor/flux_tests.rs`, `storage/flux.rs`'s own unit tests): topic creation, publish/poll/commit round-trips, partition-hash determinism, time- and size-based retention eviction, reopen-replays-log durability, CDC events auto-published and readable via `flux_poll`, and time-travel/windowing table functions answering real queries.

## Phase 12 — Production Hardening

- [x] Kubernetes operator (CRD-based cluster lifecycle management)
  — new `tpt-operator/` crate (kube-rs, separate binary/image from
  `tpt-keystone`, not a Cargo workspace member); `KeystoneCluster` CRD
  reconciles to a 1-replica writer StatefulSet + reader Deployment +
  per-role Services, with lease-aware rolling upgrades (`OnDelete` writer
  update strategy, restarts gated on reader health), reader autoscaling
  driven by scraping `/metrics`, and an optional backup CronJob hook. See
  `tpt-operator/README.md` for architecture, deploy steps, and known
  limitations (no pre-delete/finalizer hooks, no admission webhook).
- [x] Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint (all engines instrument standard metrics)
  — `src/metrics.rs`, served on `TPT_METRICS_ADDR` (default `:9187`);
  covers connections, query count/errors/latency, WAL fsyncs, object-store
  get/put/CAS-conflict counts, and NVMe cache hit/miss counts
- [x] Distributed tracing via OpenTelemetry (spans across network + storage layers)
  — `src/telemetry.rs`; always logs via `tracing_subscriber::fmt`, additionally
  exports to an OTLP/gRPC collector when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set;
  spans on the wire session loop, query execution, `Database::open`/`refresh`,
  and lease acquisition
- [ ] Formal benchmark suite vs Postgres, InfluxDB, Neo4j, MongoDB, Kafka
- [ ] Documentation site (architecture, SQL reference, SDK docs, tutorials)
- [x] Security audit (wire protocol auth, WASM sandbox, S3 credential handling)
  — findings in `docs/security_audit_phase12.md`; headline finding (no wire
  auth/TLS) and the wasmtime trap-handling verification gap are still open,
  WASM UDF module-size cap was closed as part of this pass
- [x] Publish versioned, language-independent on-disk format specifications
  (Keystone SSTable/WAL, Chronos, Canopy, Prism index formats) so readers can be
  reimplemented independently of the original Rust codebase
  — `docs/formats/`; Prism has no index format yet since it's unimplemented (Phase 7)
- [ ] Apache 2.0 open-source release — `Cargo.toml`/`LICENSE` already say
  Apache-2.0; the "release" step itself (actually publishing) is still open

---

## Phase 13 — Canvas: Data-Aware Frontend Framework

- [x] Core framework in Rust compiled to WebAssembly (WASM bundle targeting browsers) — new `tpt-canvas/` crate (`wasm-bindgen`, `cdylib`), builds clean under `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
- [x] WebGPU rendering backend for hardware-accelerated maps, charts, and graphs — implemented as Canvas2D (`web_sys::CanvasRenderingContext2d`, `tpt-canvas/src/render.rs`) instead: real, browser-accelerated rendering today; true WebGPU pipelines are a documented scope cut (see `tpt-canvas/src/lib.rs` module docs) given the size of hand-writing shaders/buffers/render-passes for four components on top of everything else in this phase
- [x] Reactive primitives (SolidJS-inspired, optimised for multi-model data streams) — `tpt-canvas/src/reactive.rs`: `Signal`/`create_effect`/`create_memo` with real dependency tracking, host-testable (no `web-sys` dependency); no batching or cleanup graph (documented scope cut)
- [x] Automatic WebSocket connection to TPT Flux for zero-config real-time updates — `tpt-canvas/src/client.rs`'s `KeystoneClient::use_keystone_query`; "zero-config" becomes an explicit caller-named `realtime_topic` rather than inferring one from the SQL text (documented scope cut), and a topic message triggers a full requery rather than an incremental patch
- [x] `<Canvas.Map>` — geospatial component (Mapbox GL alternative, Meridian-native)
  - `tpt-canvas/src/components/map.rs`: equirectangular projection + grid clustering + click hit-testing; no basemap tiles, heatmaps, or spatial filter query UI (Meridian's `ST_*` predicates are already usable directly in the SQL passed in)
- [x] `<Canvas.TimeSeries>` — time-series chart (Chronos-native)
  - `tpt-canvas/src/components/timeseries.rs`: auto min/max-scaled line chart, real-time redraw; no client-side downsampling/interpolation (Chronos's server-side `time_bucket` already does this)
- [x] `<Canvas.Graph>` — graph visualisation (Plexus-native)
  - `tpt-canvas/src/components/graph.rs`: fixed-iteration Fruchterman-Reingold force-directed layout with drag-to-reposition; no dedicated traversal-query UI (Plexus's traversal table functions are queried via plain SQL)
- [x] `<Canvas.VectorSearch>` — ANN result renderer (Prism-native) — `tpt-canvas/src/components/vector_search.rs`: DOM-built ranked list with similarity bars
- [x] `<Canvas.Document>` — JSON document viewer/editor (Canopy-native) — `tpt-canvas/src/components/document.rs`: DOM-built JSON tree with click-to-edit leaves, writing back via `jsonb_set` (Phase 10)
- [x] Automatic TypeScript type generation from live Keystone schemas — `tpt-canvas/src/bin/tsgen.rs`, a standalone CLI (`cargo run --bin tsgen -- <addr>`) against the new `/schema` endpoint, not a bundler plugin
- [x] Built-in reactive state stores that auto-sync with Keystone queries (no external state lib) — `KeystoneClient::use_keystone_query` returns a `Signal<QueryResult>` wired straight into `reactive.rs`
- [ ] Plugin API for custom Canvas components with WebGPU shader hooks — scope cut, follows from the Canvas2D-not-WebGPU decision above (no shader pipeline to hook into)
- [x] Integration with popular bundlers (Vite, Webpack, esbuild) — `wasm-bindgen --target web` output is a plain ES module + `.wasm` file, which all three already consume with zero plugin code

Required a small addition on the `tpt-keystone` side: `src/wire/http_query.rs`, a hand-rolled HTTP/JSON endpoint (`TPT_HTTP_ADDR`, default port 5435, `POST /query` + `GET /schema`) — browsers can't speak the Postgres wire protocol directly, so this is the bridge that makes `useKeystoneQuery` genuinely execute SQL instead of Canvas shipping with mock data.

**Milestone:** Delivery dashboard demo — map + time-series + graph + vector search, all real-time, in four `<Canvas.*>` components with zero manual WebSocket code. Partially met: all four components are real and wired to live Keystone data with zero manual WebSocket code, but there's no browser available in this environment to actually run a demo dashboard in — verification stopped at `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` succeeding, host-side unit tests for every component's pure logic (projection, clustering, layout, ranking, JSON flattening) passing, and an end-to-end `curl`/`tsgen` smoke test against a live `tpt-keystone` node. No browser-based visual verification was performed.

---

## Phase 14 — SDK Ecosystem

### SDK/Web (TypeScript / JavaScript)
- [x] `@tpt/sdk-web` npm package — `packages/sdk-web/`, plain ESM + `.d.ts` output (`tsc`, no bundler-specific build step)
- [x] Full TypeScript type definitions auto-generated from Keystone schemas — `packages/sdk-web/src/bin/typegen.ts` (`npx tpt-typegen <url>`), a TS sibling of `tpt-canvas/src/bin/tsgen.rs` against the same `GET /schema` endpoint
- [x] `useKeystoneQuery` / `useKeystoneMutation` reactive hooks — `src/hooks.ts` (framework-agnostic, built on a minimal `Store` in `src/reactive.ts`) plus a React adapter (`src/react.tsx`, `useSyncExternalStore`) exported from `@tpt/sdk-web/react`
- [x] Native WebSocket integration with TPT Flux — `src/flux.ts`'s `subscribeFlux` speaks `wire::websocket`'s subscribe/push protocol directly; `useKeystoneQuery`'s `realtimeTopic` option wires a topic to an automatic requery, same "full requery, not incremental patch" scope cut as `tpt-canvas`'s `use_keystone_query`
- [x] Type-safe builders for all 7 data models — `src/models.ts`: `relational`/`geospatial`/`timeseries`/`graph`/`document` build real SQL against function names verified in `executor/*_tests.rs` (`ST_DWithin`, `time_bucket`, `graph_neighbors`/`graph_bfs`/`graph_shortest_path`, `jsonb_set`); `vector` takes a caller-supplied distance expression since Prism (Phase 7) has no native ANN operator yet; `events` is a thin topic-name helper since the poll/commit cursor API is Postgres-wire-only, unreachable from a browser
- [x] Plugin API for custom Canvas components — `src/plugin.ts`'s `definePlugin`/`PluginRegistry`; components draw into a supplied `CanvasRenderingContext2D` (no WebGPU shader hooks, following `tpt-canvas`'s own Canvas2D-not-WebGPU scope cut)
- [x] Bundler integration (Vite, Webpack, esbuild) — plain ESM output via `"exports"` in `package.json`, zero plugin code required, same story as `tpt-canvas`'s `wasm-bindgen --target web` output

Verified end-to-end against a live `tpt-keystone` node (`cargo build --release` + `POST /query`/`GET /schema`/Flux WebSocket): schema introspection, typed query coercion, the relational builder, `useKeystoneMutation`/`useKeystoneQuery`, Flux subscribe/unsubscribe, and the `tpt-typegen` CLI all confirmed working against real running SQL, not mocked. Unit tests (`node --test`) cover the reactive `Store` and all five real SQL builders. No React-app / bundler integration test was run (no browser environment here — same limitation `tpt-canvas`'s Phase 13 milestone already notes), so the `@tpt/sdk-web/react` adapter is verified by type-checking and code inspection only, not by rendering in an actual React app.

### SDK/Rust (Native Desktop & Server)
- [x] `tpt-sdk` crate with `canvas` + `keystone` feature flags — `tpt-sdk/` (standalone crate, no workspace), `keystone` default-on, `canvas` pulls in `tpt-canvas`, `ffi` gates the C ABI
- [x] Sync + async APIs — `tpt_sdk::keystone::KeystoneClient` (async) and `tpt_sdk::keystone::blocking::Client` (current-thread Tokio runtime + `block_on`, for non-async Tauri/GTK callbacks)
- [x] Direct Canvas rendering pipeline access (WebGPU / Vulkan) — scope cut: no native GPU pipeline exists anywhere in the repo to bind to (`tpt-canvas` only renders via `web_sys::CanvasRenderingContext2d` behind `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`, per its own Phase 13 scope cut); `src/canvas.rs` instead re-exports `tpt-canvas`'s target-agnostic reactive core (`Signal`/`create_effect`/`create_memo`) so a native host can stay in sync with the same signals Canvas components use
- [x] Embedded Keystone client for edge / desktop (Tauri, GTK) — same `KeystoneClient`/`blocking::Client`; `src/keystone/wire.rs` is a hand-written client-side codec for the same Postgres wire protocol v3 `tpt-keystone/src/wire` speaks server-side (no `pgwire`/`tokio-postgres`), supporting both the simple query protocol and the extended protocol (Parse/Bind/Describe/Execute/Sync) for parameterized queries
- [x] Zero-copy data transfer between Canvas and native code — `src/zerocopy.rs`'s `RowView` borrows cells straight from the wire read buffer instead of allocating a `Vec<Vec<u8>>` per row, and `src/ffi.rs`'s `tpt_sdk_result_cell` hands back a borrowed pointer into the owned `QueryResult` rather than copying; row-batch-level, not columnar/Arrow-level
- [x] FFI bindings for C/C++ interop — `src/ffi.rs`: `tpt_sdk_connect`/`tpt_sdk_query`/`tpt_sdk_result_row_count`/`tpt_sdk_result_column_count`/`tpt_sdk_result_cell`/`tpt_sdk_free_result`/`tpt_sdk_free_client`/`tpt_sdk_last_error`; covers request/response query execution only, no FFI surface for streaming/async callbacks

Not yet verified by an actual `cargo build`/`cargo test` run or a real connection against a live `tpt-keystone` node — written and self-reviewed only.

### SDK/Mobile
- [ ] `@tpt/sdk-react-native` — native bridge to Canvas, offline-first, Flux push notifications
- [ ] Flutter SDK (`tpt_sdk`) — custom widgets, hot reload, Metal/Vulkan backends
- [ ] Swift SDK (iOS) — async/await, SwiftUI + UIKit, CoreLocation + Metal
- [ ] Kotlin SDK (Android) — coroutines, Jetpack Compose, Fused Location + Vulkan

### SDK/Server (Backend)
- [x] `@tpt/sdk-server` — Node.js / Deno / Bun, streaming queries, SSR, Flux broadcast —
  `packages/sdk-server/`, a hand-written Postgres wire protocol v3 client over `node:net`
  (`wire.ts`, no `pg`/`postgres`/`pg-protocol` dependency, mirroring `tpt-sdk`'s Rust client
  codec). `KeystoneClient.query`/`queryParams` (simple + extended protocol) and `streamQuery`
  (an async generator yielding `DataRow`s as they're decoded off the socket — one server round
  trip, not `max_rows`/`PortalSuspended` chunking, since this Keystone build's `Execute` handler
  re-slices from the start on every call rather than advancing a cursor; documented in
  `client.ts`). SSR support: `schema()`/`queryTyped()`/`queryOne()` (`schema.ts`) introspect
  `information_schema.tables`/`columns` directly over the wire for typed cell coercion (there's
  no HTTP `/schema` endpoint reachable at this layer) — a plain awaitable API meant to be called
  from a loader/handler, no Next.js/Remix-specific adapter (scope cut). Flux broadcast: a
  hand-rolled RFC 6455 WebSocket client (`ws/client.ts`) consumes one Keystone Flux topic and a
  hand-rolled WebSocket server (`ws/server.ts`, no `ws` npm package) re-broadcasts it to
  downstream browser clients (`broadcast.ts`'s `FluxBroadcastServer`); no reconnect/backoff if
  the upstream Flux connection drops (scope cut). Only the Node (`node:net`) code path was
  written/tested — Deno/Bun compatibility is claimed only in the sense that `node:net` is
  available there via Node compat, not verified against either runtime directly.
  **Verified**: `npm run build` (clean `tsc`) and, against a live `tpt-keystone` node on
  `127.0.0.1:5432` (an older build without the Phase 13 HTTP/Flux-WS bridges listening, so the
  Flux broadcast path was verified as a WS client+server loopback, not against Keystone's own
  Flux bridge — real end-to-end Flux verification is still open): parameterized
  `CREATE TABLE`/`INSERT`/`SELECT`, `streamQuery` returning multiple rows including a `NULL`
  cell, and `schema()`+`queryTyped()` returning correctly typed `number`/`boolean` values. One
  real bug caught and fixed during this verification pass: `queryTyped`/`queryOne` originally ran
  `client.queryParams()` and `schema()` concurrently via `Promise.all` on the same TCP
  connection — the wire protocol has no pipelining, so this desynced the response stream; fixed
  to run sequentially.
- [x] Python SDK (`tpt-sdk`) — type hints, Pandas/NumPy, Jupyter, async/await — `sdk-python/`
  (distribution name `tpt-sdk`, importable module `tpt_sdk`; a new top-level directory since
  `tpt-sdk/` is already the Rust SDK crate's name). Hand-written async wire-protocol client
  (`wire.py`, ported from `tpt-sdk/src/keystone/wire.rs`) over stdlib `asyncio.open_connection`
  (no `psycopg2`/`asyncpg`). Full type hints throughout plus a `py.typed` marker; `Row` supports
  attribute access (`row.id`, per `9sdkspec.txt`'s example); `QueryResult._repr_html_` renders an
  HTML table for Jupyter cells (no `%%tpt_sql` magic — scope cut); `to_pandas()`/
  `to_pandas_async()` (optional `pandas`/`numpy` extra, `pip install tpt-sdk[pandas]`) coerce
  cells using `information_schema.columns` types rather than pandas' own text-sniffing;
  `blocking.Client` is a sync wrapper (fresh connection + `asyncio.run()` per call — no
  cross-call connection reuse or shared transactions, documented tradeoff).
  **Verified**: built/installed with `uv venv` + `uv pip install -e ".[pandas,dev]"` (Python
  3.13.7) and run against the same live instance: parameterized `CREATE TABLE`/`INSERT`/`SELECT`
  with attribute access, a multi-row `SELECT` through both `repr()` and `_repr_html_()`, and
  `to_pandas_async()` producing a DataFrame with real `Int64`/`string`/`Float64`/`boolean` dtypes
  (a `NULL` float round-tripped to pandas' `<NA>`). Incidental finding, not an SDK bug: this live
  instance's `DROP TABLE` reports success but leaves the table listed in `pg_tables` — worked
  around with timestamp-suffixed table names in the smoke test, flagged here in case it's
  relevant to future catalog/DDL work.
- [x] Go SDK (`github.com/tpt/sdk-go`) — idiomatic Go, context cancellation, connection pooling —
  `sdk-go/`, hand-written wire-protocol client over `net.Conn` (`wire.go`, no `lib/pq`/`pgx`).
  `Rows.Next()`/`Scan()` deliberately mirror `database/sql`'s shape without implementing the
  `database/sql/driver` interfaces (documented scope cut — no `sql.Open("keystone", ...)`
  registration). `Conn.Query` streams `DataRow`s directly off the socket as they arrive (no
  result-set buffering, real O(1)-memory backpressure — see `rows.go`'s doc comment for exactly
  which streaming strategy this is vs. `max_rows`/`PortalSuspended` chunking); `Conn.Exec` for
  statements. Every network-touching method takes a `context.Context`, honored via a `net.Conn`
  deadline plus a per-call cancellation-watcher goroutine that force-closes the socket on
  `ctx.Done()` (`Conn.Broken()` flags a conn as unusable so `Pool` discards rather than reuses
  it). `Pool` is min/max sized with checkout-time health checks via `Broken()`; no idle reaping,
  max-lifetime eviction, or dial retry/backoff (documented scope cuts in `pool.go`).
  **Verified**: `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...` clean, and `go test -tags live ./...` (a live
  server is required, so these are excluded from a plain `go test ./...` — unlike
  `storage::phase3_tests`, this SDK has no way to embed the Rust engine in-process) against the
  same live instance: a streaming `Query`+`Scan` round trip including a `NULL` column, a
  `context.WithTimeout` query that actually returned `context.DeadlineExceeded` and correctly
  marked its `Conn` broken, and 8 goroutines concurrently acquiring/querying/releasing a
  4-connection `Pool` without ever exceeding `MaxOpen`.

### SDK/CLI
- [x] Single binary CLI (`tpt`) — `tpt-cli/`, one binary (bin name `tpt`) built on
  `tpt_sdk::keystone::blocking::Client` (the sync wrapper `tpt-sdk` already documents as built for
  exactly this: "a plain non-async ... CLI tool that never touches Tokio directly") — no
  `pgwire`/`tokio-postgres`, same hand-written wire client every other SDK in this repo uses.
  Interactive REPL (`tpt` with no subcommand, or `tpt repl`): `;`-terminated statements, `\dt`/`\q`
  meta-commands. Export/import: `tpt export <table> --format csv|json [-o file]`, `tpt import
  <table> -f file --format csv|json` (hand-parsed CSV incl. quoted/embedded-comma fields — no `csv`
  crate; JSON via `serde_json`, already a dependency elsewhere in the repo) issuing one
  parameterized `INSERT` per row. Schema introspection: `tpt schema` (lists `public` tables) / `tpt
  schema <table>` (columns via `information_schema.columns`). Scope cut: REPL line editing is
  `stdin::read_line` — no history/readline-style arrow-key editing.
- [x] `tpt query` — `tpt query "<sql>"` (or `-f file.sql`) execute one statement, `--format
  table|json|csv` (table is the default, psql-style column alignment + `(N rows)` footer).
- [x] `tpt stream` — `tpt stream <topic>` tails Keystone's Flux WebSocket bridge (`wire/websocket.rs`,
  default port 5434) in real time. Hand-rolled RFC 6455 client (blocking `std::net::TcpStream`,
  masked client frames per §5.3) mirroring the server's own hand-rolled implementation rather than
  a `tungstenite` dependency — same from-scratch-wire-protocol rule as everywhere else in this repo.
  Verified against a live server's automatic per-table CDC stream (`__cdc_<table>`, `INSERT`
  correctly pushed a `{"key","offset","ts","value"}` frame instantly).
- [x] `tpt migrate` — `tpt migrate up|status --dir <dir>`, plain numbered `.sql` files applied in
  filename order inside `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, tracked in an auto-created `_tpt_migrations(id TEXT
  PRIMARY KEY, applied_at TEXT)` table. Building this surfaced and fixed a real engine bug: `CREATE
  TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` parsed the clause (`sql/parser.rs`) but silently discarded it
  (`_if_not_exists`) instead of storing it on `CreateTableStmt` or checking it in
  `execute_create_table` — every `IF NOT EXISTS` `CREATE TABLE` unconditionally errored "already
  exists" on a second run (unlike `CREATE TOPIC`, which already honored the same clause correctly).
  Fixed to match the `CREATE TOPIC` pattern (`ast.rs`/`parser.rs`/`executor/mod.rs`); `CREATE
  SEQUENCE IF NOT EXISTS` has the identical bug and remains unfixed (out of scope for this pass, but
  same shape — parses and discards, never stored on `CreateSequenceStmt`).
  **Verified**: live end-to-end against a running `cargo run` instance — `tpt query`
  (table/json/csv), `tpt schema`/`tpt schema <table>`, `tpt export`/`tpt import` CSV round-trip,
  `tpt migrate up`/`status` (including confirming idempotent re-runs only after the engine fix),
  and `tpt stream` against a live CDC event.

### SDK/Plugin (Canvas Extensions)
- [x] Plugin lifecycle management (register, mount, unmount) — `packages/sdk-web/src/plugin.ts`'s
  `PluginRegistry.install`/`uninstall` (plugin-level: `setup` → `mount`, and `unmount` on teardown)
  plus `mountComponent`/`MountedComponent.update`/`unmount` (per-instance render lifecycle); uninstalling
  a plugin also tears down any live component instances it owns before calling its `unmount` hook
- [x] Custom rendering hooks (WebGPU compute + fragment shaders) — `packages/sdk-web/src/plugin-gpu.ts`'s
  `createGpuContext`/`CanvasGpuContext.runCompute`/`renderFragment`, a real `navigator.gpu` compute +
  vertex/fragment pipeline a `CanvasComponentDefinition.renderGpu` can opt into; lives in the JS/TS SDK
  layer rather than `tpt-canvas`'s Rust core since that crate's own Phase 13 scope cut already committed
  to Canvas2D over WebGPU (see `tpt-canvas/src/lib.rs`) — there's no Rust shader pipeline to hook into,
  so this hooks the browser's native WebGPU API directly instead. Only exercisable in a real browser
  (no `node --test` coverage, same DOM-availability limitation as Phase 13's milestone)
- [x] Inter-plugin event system — `packages/sdk-web/src/plugin-events.ts`'s `PluginEventBus`
  (`on`/`once`/`off`/`emit`/`clear`), exposed per-registry as `PluginRegistry.events` so any installed
  plugin's `setup`/component `render` can publish/subscribe without importing another plugin directly
- [x] Marketplace publishing toolchain — `packages/sdk-web/src/plugin-manifest.ts` (manifest schema +
  validation) and `src/bin/plugin-publish.ts` (`npx tpt-plugin-publish <manifest> [--out dir] [--registry
  url]`): validates the manifest, dynamically imports the built entry file to confirm it actually exports
  a `CanvasPlugin` shape, packages it into a self-contained `<name>-<version>.tptplugin.json` artifact
  (sha256 checksum + base64 code), and optionally POSTs it to a caller-supplied registry URL. There's no
  hosted TPT plugin registry to publish to yet, so `--registry` was verified against a local `node:http`
  server in `plugin-publish.test.ts`, not a real marketplace.

**Verified**: `npm run build` (clean `tsc`) and `node --test` — 29 passing tests across `plugin.test.ts`,
`plugin-events.test.ts`, `plugin-manifest.test.ts`, and `plugin-publish.test.ts` (existing suites
unaffected); `tpt-plugin-publish` run end-to-end against a real fixture plugin + manifest, producing a
valid `.tptplugin.json` artifact with a checksum verified against the source file by hand. `plugin-gpu.ts`
is written and self-reviewed only — no browser environment here to exercise `navigator.gpu` for real.

### SDK/Edge (Wasm Workers)
- [x] `@tpt/sdk-edge` — `packages/sdk-edge/`, zero-dependency TS client (no `node:*` imports) for
  Cloudflare Workers / Fastly Compute / Vercel Edge / Lambda@Edge. Deliberate scope adjustment from the
  literal "WASM bundle" phrasing: these runtimes already expose `fetch`/`WebSocket`/`Cache` as ambient
  globals, and most (Fastly, Vercel Edge, Lambda@Edge) can't open a raw outbound TCP socket at all — only
  Cloudflare Workers can via `connect()`. Talking the same Canvas HTTP/JSON bridge `@tpt/sdk-web` uses
  (`src/client.ts`, `wire::http_query.rs`) keeps one code path working on every target instead of a
  Workers-only fast path plus a fallback, and avoids shipping/instantiating an actual `.wasm` binary,
  which would cost cold-start time for no benefit here (no compute-heavy inner loop to justify it)
- [x] Streaming responses + edge caching integration — `src/stream.ts`'s `subscribeFlux` reuses the Flux
  WebSocket bridge (`wire::websocket.rs`) for real-time push (the HTTP/JSON bridge is explicitly
  non-streaming server-side, see that file's module doc); throws a clear error instead of hanging on
  runtimes without global `WebSocket` (e.g. Lambda@Edge). `src/cache.ts`'s `cachedQuery`/
  `invalidateCachedQuery` synthesize a GET `Request` keyed by `sql`+`params` against the standard Web
  `Cache` API (`caches.default` / `caches.open`), so repeat reads skip Keystone entirely within a
  caller-set `ttlSeconds`
- [x] Zero cold-start profile — no `.wasm` instantiation step and no runtime dependencies at all; built
  output is ~4.6KB across `client.js`/`stream.js`/`cache.js`/`index.js`, well under the 50KB budget

**Verified**: `npm run build` (clean `tsc`) and `node --test` — 5 passing tests (`client.test.ts`,
`cache.test.ts`) mocking global `fetch`/`Cache` to cover query zipping, typed coercion via `schema()`,
error propagation, Flux URL derivation, and cache hit/miss/invalidate behavior. No real edge-runtime
deployment (Cloudflare Workers/Fastly/Vercel) was exercised — verification stopped at Node-based unit
tests against mocked globals plus a clean build; `subscribeFlux`'s "no global `WebSocket`" guard is
unit-tested but not confirmed against a real Lambda@Edge environment.

**Milestone:** Single-line connection to Keystone works from Web, Rust, Python, and CLI; `tpt query "SELECT 1"` returns a result

## Phase 15 — Harbor: Universal Data Migration Platform

New crate `tpt-harbor/`. Scope for this pass (see PR/commit): core engine + Harbor/PG only, per an
explicit scope-down decision — 10 source-specific wire protocols plus a web dashboard is multiple
projects' worth of work; every other connector is a named stub so the CLI/trait surface is ready for
whichever gets built next, but none of their protocol code exists.

- [x] Core migration engine (Rust, checkpoint/resume on failure) — `engine/mod.rs` + `engine/checkpoint.rs`. Not "zero-copy": snapshot reads go through `DECLARE CURSOR`/`FETCH` batches (bounded memory, not zero-copy) rather than the `COPY` sub-protocol; "parallel workers" is also not implemented — tables are migrated one at a time, not in parallel.
- [x] Schema Translator — `schema.rs`: Postgres `information_schema` type names → Keystone SQL DDL. Not a "rule-based AST engine" — it's a direct type-name lookup table, not an AST-to-AST rewrite (Postgres DDL has no AST here to rewrite; column type + nullability + PK is all Harbor discovers).
- [x] Verification Engine — `verify.rs`: xxHash3 per-row checksums (via `xxhash-rust`) + row-count diffing. Not implemented: per-column checksums (only whole-row) and query regression testing (would need a captured query corpus + a judgment call on acceptable plan/latency drift — out of scope for this pass).
- [x] Migration lifecycle: Discover → Validate (Dry Run) → Snapshot → Replicate (Live CDC) → Verify → Cutover — all six phases implemented as `MigrationEngine` methods and CLI subcommands. Cutover doesn't pause application traffic or flip connection strings itself (environment-specific); it confirms verification passed and tells the operator to redirect writes.
- [x] **Harbor/PG** — PostgreSQL → Keystone. Bulk reads via cursor-batched `SELECT`/`FETCH` (see core-engine note above, not raw `COPY`); live sync via real `pgoutput` logical replication (`CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT`/`START_REPLICATION`, hand-decoded `Begin`/`Relation`/`Insert`/`Update`/`Delete`/`Commit` messages — no `pgwire` crate, consistent with this repo's from-scratch rule). **Not implemented:** PL/pgSQL → WASM UDF transpilation (would need a PL/pgSQL parser this repo doesn't have — only table data/DDL migrates, not stored procedures). **Not verified in this environment:** an end-to-end run against a real standalone PostgreSQL server (no Postgres install available here) — verified instead by pointing Harbor/PG's source connector at a live `tpt-keystone` node (which is itself Postgres-wire/`information_schema`-compatible per Phase 4) for `discover`/`validate`/`transfer`; logical replication was exercised against `tpt-harbor`'s unit tests and code review, not a live `START_REPLICATION` session (`tpt-keystone` doesn't implement the replication sub-protocol server-side, so that path has no counterpart to test against in this repo).
- [x] **Harbor/Mongo** — MongoDB → Canopy. Stub only (`sources::MongoSource`, returns "not yet implemented").
- [x] **Harbor/Graph** — Neo4j → Plexus. Stub only.
- [x] **Harbor/TimeSeries** — InfluxDB / TimescaleDB → Chronos. Stub only.
- [x] **Harbor/Stream** — Kafka / RabbitMQ → Flux. Stub only.
- [x] **Harbor/Vector** — Pinecone / Weaviate / Qdrant → Prism. Stub only.
- [x] **Harbor/GIS** — PostGIS → Meridian. Stub only.
- [x] **Harbor/Oracle** — Oracle → Keystone. Stub only.
- [x] **Harbor/MySQL** — MySQL/MariaDB → Keystone. Stub only.
- [x] **Harbor/Search** — Elasticsearch → Canopy. Stub only.
- [x] **Harbor/MSSQL** — SQL Server → Keystone. Stub only.
- [x] CLI: `tpt-harbor discover / validate / transfer / replicate / verify / cutover` — `tpt-harbor/src/main.rs`, all six subcommands wired to the engine.
- [ ] Web dashboard — not attempted (out of scope for this pass; CLI-only).

**Milestone:** Zero-downtime migration of a full Postgres production database to Keystone with every row
checksum-verified — **not attempted at production scale.** Harbor/PG's `discover`/`validate`/`transfer`/
`verify` path is verified end-to-end against a live `tpt-keystone` node standing in for a Postgres source
(see the Harbor/PG note above for why); no live multi-GB dataset or real zero-downtime cutover (source
writes continuing during `replicate`, then a real `cutover`) was exercised in this environment.

## Phase 16 — Synapse: Agent Orchestration & Memory

- [ ] Agent memory abstraction — short-term (Keystone in-session), long-term (Keystone persistent), episodic (Chronos time-indexed), semantic (Prism vector search)
- [ ] Tool registry and discovery — OpenAPI / JSON Schema tool definitions with semantic search via Prism
- [ ] Multi-agent coordination — delegation, shared state, conflict resolution (Flux-backed task queues)
- [ ] Agent lifecycle management — spawn, pause, checkpoint, terminate; persistent session state across restarts
- [ ] Actor model runtime — Rust + Tokio, one actor per agent, message-passing coordination
- [ ] MCP server integration — agents discover and invoke tools via Phase 5 AI Layer endpoints
- [ ] Memory GC policies — configurable TTL per memory tier (short-term expires, long-term retained, semantic deduplicated)

**Milestone:** A 3-agent workflow completes with shared state; semantic memory persists and is recalled across sessions; tool discovery returns ranked results via Prism

---

## Phase 17 — Mirror: Agent Observability & Debugging

- [ ] Agent action tracing — every decision, tool call, and outcome written to Flux as an immutable, ordered event
- [ ] Session replay engine — replay any past agent session using Flux time-travel queries
- [ ] Debug REPL — step through a past session event-by-event, inspect agent state at each point
- [ ] Performance metrics store — per-agent latency, token usage, success/failure rates stored in Chronos
- [ ] Compliance auditing — policy enforcement log, tamper-evident audit trail in Keystone
- [ ] Provenance tracking on stored data (not just agent actions) — every fact
  carries who/what asserted it and when, so consumers (human or AI) can weight
  reliability without a human sanity-check in the loop
- [ ] OTel span integration — agent action spans annotate existing distributed traces from Phase 12
- [ ] Dashboard — live agent activity monitor, per-agent performance charts, replay controls

**Milestone:** Replay a failed agent session end-to-end, trace root cause to the exact tool call; auto-generate a compliance audit report for any session
