## Architecture

### Module

`github.com/PhillipC05/tpt-identity` — Go 1.22, pure-Go SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`, no CGo).

### Request flow

```
HTTP request
  → api/server.go (rateLimit → audit → auth middleware)
  → handler (api/*.go)
  → oidc/ or pkg/ for domain logic
  → internal/store/ for persistence
```

The `api.Server` struct carries all runtime dependencies: `store.Store`, `oidc.Provider`, `bridge.Manager`, `bridge.Mapper`, `events.Bus`, `authn.LockoutManager`. These are wired in `cmd/tpt-identity/cmd/serve.go`.

### Cryptography invariants

- **Ed25519** for all signing (credentials, JWTs, consent receipts).
- **X25519 + NaCl secretbox** for encryption at rest and DIDComm.
- **Argon2id** (64 MB / 3 iterations / 4 threads) for every key derivation from a passphrase — this is the same constant in both `pkg/keystore/keystore.go` and `internal/authn/totp.go`; keep them in sync.
- **`did:key` may never be an issuer** of persistent credentials — `pkg/vc/issue.go` returns `ErrEphemeralIssuer` if you try. Bridge-created identities use `did:key` only as a stable identifier; auth is via the external provider.
- Proof algorithm: **DataIntegrityProof / eddsa-jcs-2022**. `pkg/crypto/hash.go` provides JCS canonicalization. The signing pipeline is `JCS(proofOptions) ‖ JCS(document) → SHA-256 → Ed25519.Sign`.

### DID methods

Registered at `init()` time via `pkg/did/method.go`'s global registry. The four methods (`web`, `key`, `peer`, and optionally `ion` under build tag) each live in their own file. `did:web` resolution fetches `https://{domain}/.well-known/did.json` with SSRF hardening (RFC-1918 blocked, 5 s timeout, max 1 redirect). The `internal/resolver` package wraps DID resolution with a TTL cache.

### SD-JWT selective disclosure

`pkg/vc/sdjwt.go` implements SD-JWT (draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt) as a second credential format alongside the W3C DataIntegrityProof VCs:

- `IssueSDJWT(opts)` → `*SDJWTToken` — produces a JWT (`vc+sd-jwt` typ) where each selective claim is replaced by its SHA-256 hash in the `_sd` array. The `SDJWTToken` holds the JWT and all `Disclosure` values.
- `token.Present(keys)` → string — holder picks which claims to reveal; returns `<jwt>~<selected_discs>~`
- `token.PresentWithKeyBinding(keys, holderKey, kid, nonce, aud)` → string — appends a `kb+jwt` that binds the presentation to a verifier nonce (anti-replay)
- `SDJWTVerifier.Verify(token, nonce, aud)` — resolves the issuer DID, verifies the JWT signature, checks each presented disclosure hash against `_sd`, and validates the KB-JWT if present

**Key constraints:**
- `_sd_alg` is always `sha-256`; `cnf` is optional (used for KB-JWT holder key binding)
- `did:key` is blocked as issuer (same `ErrEphemeralIssuer` as W3C VCs)
- `AlwaysVisibleClaims` go directly into the JWT payload; `SelectiveClaims` are hashed
- The `vct` claim carries the versioned schema ID (analogous to `@type` in W3C VCs)
- `api.Server` needs `signingKey`+`signingKeyID` populated (via `Config.SigningKey`) — both credential handlers (`handleIssueCredential` and `handleIssueSDJWT`) use the platform signing key, not caller-provided keys

### Credential schemas

`pkg/schema/registry.go` holds the in-memory registry. All 50+ schemas are registered by the `init()` calls in `pkg/schema/core/*.go` — the serve command blank-imports this package (`_ "github.com/PhillipC05/tpt-identity/pkg/schema/core"`). Tests that need schemas must do the same. Schema IDs are versioned: `healthcare.nhi-credential-v1`; the registry can look up by base ID (`healthcare.nhi-credential`) to find the latest version.

Schemas marked `ExtraSensitive: true` (mental-health, addiction, criminal-record, etc.) require a separate, individually confirmed consent grant even when a category grant is active — enforced in `api/consents.go` and `pkg/consent/policy.go`.

### OIDC provider

`oidc.Provider` is the OIDC server. Every authorize call requires both `state` (CSRF) and `code_challenge` (PKCE S256). Client registration (`POST /oidc/register`, RFC 7591) is required before a `client_id` is accepted — `AuthorizeHandler` validates against the store. Tokens are EdDSA-signed JWTs; the JWKS (`GET /.well-known/jwks.json`) exposes the public key for downstream verification. Refresh tokens are stored by `sha256(raw_token)`, rotated on every use, with a consumed-token grace window to detect theft.

### Identity bridge

`internal/bridge/bridge.go` defines the `Bridge` interface. Providers (OIDC RP, magic link, password, SAML†, LDAP†) authenticate and return an `ExternalIdentity{Provider, ExternalID, Claims}`. `internal/bridge/mapper.go` finds or creates the corresponding platform DID in the store; each external identity maps to exactly one DID. Account linking (`POST /api/v1/me/links`) attaches additional providers to an existing DID. The bridge HTTP handlers in `api/bridge.go` use a HMAC-signed state token to carry OIDC flow parameters across the external provider redirect without a server-side state table.

†Require build tags: `-tags saml` / `-tags ldap`.

### Persistence

`internal/store/store.go` defines the `Store` interface; `internal/store/sqlite.go` is the only implementation. Schema migrations live in `internal/store/migrations/*.sql` and are applied by the embedded runner — `tpt-identity migrate up` applies them; the schema is PostgreSQL-compatible for a future migration. All list/get operations use the context for cancellation. `OIDCSession` stores PKCE challenge, state, user-agent, IP, and refresh token hash alongside the auth code.

### Consent and receipts

Grants are soft-deleted (`RevokedAt` set, never `DELETE`d) for NZ Privacy Act 2020 audit trail compliance. Receipts are append-only and cryptographically signed. The `pkg/consent/policy.go` enforcer checks grant expiry, category vs. schema level, and extra-sensitive overrides before allowing credential access.

### Webhook events

`internal/events/events.go` provides a typed event bus. `events.Bus.Publish` fans out to subscribers from the store, delivers via HTTP POST with `X-TPT-Signature-256: sha256=<hmac>`, and retries up to 3 times with exponential backoff. Published on: `credential.issued`, `credential.revoked`, `consent.granted`, `consent.revoked`, `identity.created`, `session.created`, `session.revoked`, `session.duress`, `consent.expiring_soon`, `recovery.initiated`, `recovery.approved`.

The bus also supports in-process `LocalSubscriber` callbacks via `events.Bus.Subscribe(fn)` — used by the audit logger and marketplace registry.

### Duress code

`internal/authn/duress.go` — `DuressManager` stores an Argon2id hash of a secondary passphrase. When the password bridge authenticates with the duress passphrase, the session is created normally (so a coercer sees success) and a `session.duress` event fires silently. Enrol via `POST /api/v1/me/duress/enrol`; remove via `DELETE /api/v1/me/duress`.

### Back-channel logout

`oidc/backchannel.go` — `Provider.SendBackChannelLogout(ctx, clientID, subjectDID)` builds a signed `logout_token` JWT and POSTs it to the client's `backchannel_logout_uri`. Called on session revocation. Clients register their logout URI via `POST /oidc/register`. Advertised in the OIDC discovery document as `backchannel_logout_supported: true`.

### Client credentials grant

`POST /token` with `grant_type=client_credentials` — M2M authentication for downstream services. Only allowed for clients with `token_endpoint_auth_method: client_secret_basic` or `client_secret_post`. Issues an access token with `sub=client_id`; no refresh token.

### Magic link

TTL is **15 minutes** (hardcoded in `internal/bridge/providers/magiclink.go`). Tokens are single-use.

### Verifiable audit log

`internal/auditlog/auditlog.go` — subscribes to all `events.Bus` events and appends each to an `audit_log` table as `SHA-256(prev_hash ‖ event_json)`. `GET /api/v1/audit-log` returns events in sequence order. `GET /api/v1/audit-log/proof/{seq}` returns the hash chain from `seq` to head for third-party verification.

### Guardian recovery

`pkg/recovery/recovery.go` — GF(256) Shamir secret sharing. `Split(secret, threshold, n)` → `[]Share`; `Combine(shares)` → secret. The API enrols guardians via `POST /api/v1/me/recovery/enrol`, initiates recovery via `POST /api/v1/recovery/initiate`, and guardians approve via `POST /api/v1/recovery/{id}/approve`.

### Credential marketplace

`pkg/marketplace/registry.go` — in-memory registry updated on every `credential.issued` event. `GET /api/v1/marketplace` returns `[{issuer_did, schema_id, schema_name, issued_count}]`. Enabled by `marketplace.advertise: true` in config.

### Prometheus metrics

`GET /metrics` (gated by `api_key` if set) exposes:
- `tpt_http_requests_total{method,path,status}` — counter
- `tpt_http_request_duration_seconds{method,path}` — histogram
- `tpt_credentials_issued_total{format}` — counter
- `tpt_webhook_deliveries_total{result}` — counter

### DIDComm v2 messaging

`pkg/didcomm/didcomm.go` implements DIDComm v2 JWE JSON Serialized envelopes (https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/):

- **`PackAnoncrypt(msg, recipients)`** — ECDH-ES+A256KW+XC20P; per-recipient ephemeral X25519 keypair; sender is hidden.
- **`PackAuthcrypt(msg, recipients, senderKID, senderPriv)`** — ECDH-1PU+A256KW+XC20P; sender's static X25519 key is bound into each recipient's KEK.
- **`Unpack(envelope, recipKeyFn, senderPubFn)`** — decodes protected header, tries each recipient until one succeeds; `senderPubFn` is called only for authcrypt to verify the sender key (may be nil for anoncrypt-only servers).

**Key derivation**: Concat KDF (NIST SP 800-56A / RFC 7518 §4.6.2) — `SHA-256(counter || Z || algID || PartyUInfo || PartyVInfo || keydatalen)`. For authcrypt: `Z = Ze || Zs` where `Ze = ECDH(ephem, recip)` and `Zs = ECDH(sender_static, recip)`.

**`apv`**: `base64url(SHA-256(sorted recipient KIDs joined with "."))` — included in all envelopes; used in the KDF.

**`POST /didcomm`** (public, rate-limited): receives a JWE envelope, decrypts with the platform X25519 key, parses the `Message`, logs it, and returns 202 with `{message_id, type}`. Requires `identity.enc_key` and `identity.enc_key_id` config fields (or auto-derives `<issuer>#enc-key-1`).

**Config**: add `identity.enc_key` (path to X25519 PEM) and optionally `identity.enc_key_id` to `config.yaml` to enable DIDComm receive. Use `keygen --method web` which already writes both Ed25519 and X25519 key files.

**Key constraints**:
- Per-recipient ephemeral X25519 keypair — each recipient gets a different Z, different KEK, same CEK.
- `apv` is shared across recipients (in the protected header), computed over all recipient KIDs sorted lexicographically.
- AES-256-KW integrity check detects wrong KEK (RFC 3394 default IV `0xA6A6A6A6A6A6A6A6`).
- `api/didcomm.go:decodeX25519Multibase` handles both standard `z`+base58btc multibase and the `z`+base64url fallback encoding from `did:peer`.

### Trusted proxies / CORS

`server.trusted_proxies` (CIDR list): `X-Forwarded-For` is only trusted when the direct connection IP is in this list; otherwise `RemoteAddr` is used for rate limiting.

`cors.allowed_origins` (string list): enables CORS with the given origins. Empty list = CORS disabled.

## Key constraints and non-obvious rules

- **`did:key` cannot issue persistent VCs** — `ErrEphemeralIssuer` enforced in `vc.Issue`.
- **PKCE + state are mandatory** on every `/authorize` call — no opt-out.
- **Client registration required** — `AuthorizeHandler` rejects unknown `client_id` values; downstream TPT modules must call `POST /oidc/register` first.
- **Extra-sensitive schemas need individual grants** — category grants alone are insufficient for mental-health, sexual-health, reproductive-health, addiction, criminal-record schemas.
- **LDAP requires `ldaps://`** — plaintext `ldap://` returns an error at bridge construction, not at runtime.
- **Argon2id is slow by design** — don't call it in tests without a deterministic fixture or it will dominate test time.
- **Schema `init()` must be imported** — tests touching schema validation need `_ "github.com/PhillipC05/tpt-identity/pkg/schema/core"`.
- **SQLite is single-writer** — `db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)` is intentional; don't remove it.
- **`did:peer` uses base64url multibase prefix `u`** — the multicodec key bytes are base64url-encoded with prefix `u`, not base58btc (`z`). The VC verifier has a fallback for `u`-prefixed keys.
- **Webhook `handleListWebhooks` passes `""` as eventType** — `ListWebhookSubscriptions("", ...)` returns all subscriptions regardless of event type; non-empty values filter by event type. Do not change this to `"*"`.
- **`SetWebResolverConfig` writes directly to `methods["web"]`** — it does not call `RegisterMethod` (which panics on re-registration). Keep this pattern for test helpers that reconfigure the web resolver.
- **`ValidFor < 0` in `vc.Issue` / `IssueReputationVC`** — negative values set an already-expired `ValidUntil` (useful for tests). Zero means no expiry. Both `vc.Issue` and `trust.IssueReputationVC` handle this identically.

## Configuration

Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml`. Key fields: `issuer` (canonical HTTPS URL, used as OIDC issuer and `did:web` base), `identity.signing_key` (path to Ed25519 PEM), `identity.passphrase` (Argon2id key derivation), `api_key` (Bearer token for protected admin endpoints). Bridge providers are configured under `bridges.oidc[]`. TOTP uses `totp_passphrase` (defaults to `identity.passphrase`). Environment variable override prefix: `TPT_IDENTITY_`.

New fields: `server.trusted_proxies` (CIDR list for `X-Forwarded-For` trust), `cors.allowed_origins` (CORS opt-in), `consent.expiry_warning_days` (default 7), `marketplace.advertise` (bool, enables `GET /api/v1/marketplace`), `log.level`, `log.format`.
